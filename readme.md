## Kasi LifeStyle | Shoe Catalog

Kasi LifeStyle application is an online shoe catalog that I built. The application allows users to search for shoes, add shoes to the shopping cart and also allows users to add their own shoes into the store.

You can find the application at: https://tommyshado.github.io/shoe-catalog/layouts/index.html

You can also find the application unit testing at: https://tommyshado.github.io/shoe-catalog/unit-testing/index.test.html
